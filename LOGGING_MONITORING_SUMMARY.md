## Usage Examples

### Basic Logging
```python
from geminisdr.core import get_logger
from geminisdr.config.config_models import LoggingConfig

logger = get_logger("my_module", LoggingConfig())
logger.info("Application started", version="1.0.0")

# With context
logger.add_context(user_id="123", session="abc")
logger.info("User action performed")

# Performance timing
with logger.performance_timer("database_query"):
    # Database operation
    pass
```

### Metrics Collection
```python
from geminisdr.core import MetricsCollector
from geminisdr.config.config_models import SystemConfig

collector = MetricsCollector(SystemConfig())

# Record different metric types
collector.record_counter("requests.total", 1)
collector.record_gauge("memory.usage", 75.5)
collector.record_timer("api.response_time", 0.125)

# ML metrics
collector.record_ml_metrics(
    model_name="neural_amr",
    operation="training",
    epoch=10,
    loss=0.25,
    accuracy=0.95
)

# Health checks
def database_health():
    return True  # Check database connection

collector.register_health_check("database", database_health)
health_results = collector.run_health_checks()
```

### Monitoring and Alerting
```python
# Alert callback
def handle_alert(alert):
    print(f"Alert: {alert.message}")
    # Send to monitoring system

collector.register_alert_callback(handle_alert)

# Start background monitoring
collector.start_monitoring()

# Get dashboard data
dashboard_data = collector.get_dashboard_data()
```

- Background monitoring to avoid blocking operations
- Minimal overhead for metric recording

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Thread-safe operations throughout
- Graceful degradation on component failures

### Observability

## Next Steps

The logging and monitoring system is now ready for integration with the rest of the GeminiSDR codebase. The next logical steps would be:

1. **Integration with existing modules** (Task 8.1-8.2)
2. **Documentation updates** (Task 9.1-9.2)
3. **Performance validation** (Task 10.1-10.2)

The system provides a solid foundation for observability and monitoring across the entire GeminiSDR platform.
