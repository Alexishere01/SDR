# Reinforcement Learning Design Deep Dive: State, Action, Reward

## State Space Design Analysis

### Current State Vector (256 dimensions)

```python
state = [
    spectrum_bins[250],      # Frequency domain information
    current_freq_norm[1],    # Current tuning frequency (normalized)
    current_gain_norm[1],    # Current gain setting (normalized)
    bandwidth_factor[1],     # Current bandwidth factor
    snr_estimate[1],         # Estimated SNR
    signal_power[1],         # Signal power estimate
    noise_floor[1]           # Noise floor estimate
]
```

### Why This State Representation?

#### 1. Spectrum Bins (250 dimensions) - The "Eyes" of the System

**Engineering Rationale:**
- **Frequency Domain Visibility:** The AI needs to "see" the spectrum to make intelligent decisions
- **Pattern Recognition:** Different modulations have distinct spectral signatures
- **Interference Detection:** Can identify jammers, noise, and other signals
- **Signal Localization:** Pinpoints where signals are within the 1.6 MHz window

**Why 250 bins specifically?**
- **Original FFT:** 1024 bins from 2048-point FFT
- **Downsampling Factor:** 4x reduction (1024 → 250)
- **Computational Efficiency:** Balance between information and processing speed
- **Neural Network Input:** Manageable size for real-time inference

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
```python
# Option 1: Full Resolution (rejected - too large)
spectrum_bins[1024]  # 1024 dimensions - computationally expensive

# Option 2: Heavy Downsampling (rejected - too little info)
spectrum_bins[64]    # 64 dimensions - loses important spectral details

# Option 3: Adaptive Binning (future work)
spectrum_bins[variable]  # Focus resolution where signals detected
```

#### 2. Current Settings (3 dimensions) - The "Proprioception"

**Why Include Current Settings?**
- **Relative Action Planning:** AI needs to know where it is to decide where to go
- **Hysteresis Prevention:** Avoids oscillating between settings
- **Context for Spectrum:** Same spectrum looks different at different gains

**Normalization Strategy:**
```python
freq_norm = (current_freq - 70e6) / (6e9 - 70e6)     # [0, 1] range
gain_norm = current_gain / 70                         # [0, 1] range  
bw_factor = bandwidth / sample_rate                   # [0.1, 0.9] range
```

**Why Normalize?**
- **Neural Network Stability:** Prevents gradient explosion/vanishing
- **Equal Importance:** All features contribute equally to learning
- **Faster Convergence:** Optimization works better with similar scales

#### 3. Performance Metrics (3 dimensions) - The "Feedback"

**SNR Estimate:**
- **Direct Objective:** Primary goal is SNR maximization
- **Real-time Feedback:** Immediate indication of tuning quality
- **Gradient Information:** Shows if adjustments are improving/degrading

**Signal Power & Noise Floor:**
- **Decomposed SNR:** Understanding WHY SNR is good/bad
- **Adaptive Strategies:** High noise → increase gain, Low signal → change frequency
- **Robustness:** Separate signal and noise characteristics

### State Space Alternatives Analyzed

#### Alternative 1: Time-Domain State
```python
# Raw I/Q samples as state
state = raw_iq_samples[1024]  # Complex samples directly
```
**Pros:** Complete information preservation
**Cons:** 2048 dimensions (I+Q), computationally prohibitive, poor generalization

#### Alternative 2: Compressed Spectral State  
```python
# PCA-compressed spectrum
state = pca_spectrum[50] + settings[6]  # 56 total dimensions
```
**Pros:** Smaller state space, faster training
**Cons:** Information loss, PCA basis needs retraining for different scenarios

#### Alternative 3: Multi-Resolution State
```python
# Different frequency resolutions
state = [
    coarse_spectrum[64],    # Wide view, low resolution
    fine_spectrum[128],     # Narrow view, high resolution  
    settings[6]
]
```
**Pros:** Multi-scale awareness, efficient information encoding
**Cons:** Complex preprocessing, harder to interpret

**Why We Chose Current Design:**
- **Information Completeness:** Captures essential spectral information
- **Computational Feasibility:** 256 dimensions manageable for real-time
- **Interpretability:** Each dimension has clear physical meaning
- **Proven Architecture:** Similar to successful image recognition CNNs

## Action Space Design Analysis

### Current Action Space (3D Continuous → Discretized)

```python
actions = [
    frequency_adjustment,  # Δf ∈ [-500kHz, +500kHz]
    gain_adjustment,       # Δg ∈ [-5dB, +5dB]  
    bandwidth_adjustment   # Δbw ∈ [-0.2, +0.2]
]
```

### Why These Three Actions?

#### 1. Frequency Adjustment - The Primary Search Mechanism

**Engineering Justification:**
- **Signal Acquisition:** Most important parameter for finding signals
- **Interference Avoidance:** Move away from jammers/noise
- **Tracking:** Follow drifting or hopping transmitters

**Range Selection: ±500 kHz**
```python
# Why not larger?
±2MHz  # Too large - might jump over narrow signals
±5MHz  # Way too large - loses fine control

# Why not smaller?  
±100kHz  # Too small - slow to escape interference
±50kHz   # Too small - inefficient search
```

**Step Size: 100 kHz (11 discrete levels)**
- **Channel Spacing:** Matches typical digital communication channels
- **Hardware Precision:** PlutoSDR frequency resolution
- **Search Efficiency:** Balance between precision and speed

#### 2. Gain Adjustment - The Signal Optimization Mechanism

**Engineering Justification:**
- **SNR Optimization:** Maximize signal while avoiding saturation
- **Dynamic Range:** Adapt to varying signal strengths
- **Noise Management:** Optimize signal-to-noise ratio

**Range Selection: ±5 dB**
```python
# Why this range?
±10dB  # Too large - can cause instability, saturation
±20dB  # Way too large - dramatic changes, poor control

±2dB   # Too small - insufficient optimization range
±1dB   # Too small - very slow optimization
```

**Step Size: 1 dB (11 discrete levels)**
- **RF Engineering Standard:** 1 dB is standard granularity
- **Perceptual Significance:** 1 dB ≈ 26% power change (meaningful)
- **Hardware Matching:** Typical SDR gain step size

#### 3. Bandwidth Adjustment - The Selectivity Mechanism

**Engineering Justification:**
- **Noise Rejection:** Narrow bandwidth reduces noise
- **Signal Capture:** Wide bandwidth captures signal components
- **Interference Mitigation:** Optimize filter characteristics

**Range Selection: ±20% of sample rate**
```python
# At 2 MHz sample rate:
±0.2 * 2MHz = ±400kHz bandwidth change

# Why this range?
±50%   # Too large - might lose signal entirely
±10%   # Too small - insufficient optimization
```

### Action Space Alternatives Analyzed

#### Alternative 1: Single Action (Frequency Only)
```python
action = frequency_adjustment  # 1D action space
```
**Pros:** Simple, fast learning, clear objective
**Cons:** Cannot optimize gain/bandwidth, suboptimal performance

#### Alternative 2: High-Resolution Actions
```python
actions = [
    freq_adjust,     # 21 levels instead of 11
    gain_adjust,     # 21 levels instead of 11
    bandwidth_adjust # 21 levels instead of 11
]
# Total: 21³ = 9,261 actions
```
**Pros:** Finer control, better precision
**Cons:** 7x larger action space, much slower learning

#### Alternative 3: Continuous Actions (DDPG/SAC)
```python
actions = [
    freq_adjust,     # Continuous [-500kHz, +500kHz]
    gain_adjust,     # Continuous [-5dB, +5dB]
    bandwidth_adjust # Continuous [-0.2, +0.2]
]
```
**Pros:** Infinite precision, no discretization artifacts
**Cons:** More complex algorithms, harder to debug, less stable

#### Alternative 4: Hierarchical Actions
```python
# Two-level hierarchy
coarse_action = search_direction    # North/South/East/West in freq-gain space
fine_action = adjustment_magnitude  # How far to move
```
**Pros:** Natural search patterns, faster exploration
**Cons:** Complex action interpretation, harder to train

**Why We Chose Current Design:**
- **Proven DQN Compatibility:** Discrete actions work well with Q-learning
- **Balanced Granularity:** 11³ = 1,331 actions - large enough for precision, small enough for learning
- **Physical Intuition:** Each action corresponds to meaningful RF adjustment
- **Debugging Capability:** Easy to interpret and visualize actions

## Reward Function Design Analysis

### Current Reward Function

```python
def calculate_reward(snr, freq_error):
    # Primary reward: Achieved SNR
    reward = snr
    
    # Frequency accuracy bonus
    if freq_error < 100e3:      # Within 100 kHz
        reward += 30
    elif freq_error < 500e3:    # Within 500 kHz  
        reward += 10
    
    # Penalty for being far off
    if freq_error > 2e6:        # More than 2 MHz off
        reward -= 20
    
    # SNR achievement bonus
    if snr > 15:                # Good signal quality
        reward += 10
        
    return reward
```

### Why This Reward Structure?

#### 1. Primary Reward: SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

**Engineering Rationale:**
- **Direct Objective:** SNR is the fundamental measure of signal quality
- **Continuous Feedback:** Provides gradient information for optimization
- **Universal Metric:** Works across all signal types and scenarios

**Why SNR vs Alternatives?**
```python
# Alternative 1: Binary reward (rejected)
reward = 1 if signal_detected else 0
# Problem: No gradient, sparse feedback, slow learning

# Alternative 2: Signal power (rejected)  
reward = signal_power
# Problem: Doesn't account for noise, can be gamed

# Alternative 3: BER/SINR (future consideration)
reward = -bit_error_rate  # or SINR
# Problem: Requires demodulation, computationally expensive
```

#### 2. Frequency Accuracy Bonus - The "Bullseye" Reward

**Why Frequency-Specific Bonuses?**
- **Target Guidance:** Encourages finding the actual signal location
- **Precision Incentive:** Rewards accurate tuning, not just "good enough"
- **Exploration vs Exploitation:** Balances search with optimization

**Bonus Structure Analysis:**
```python
# Tier 1: ±100 kHz → +30 points
# - Very precise tuning
# - Within typical channel bandwidth
# - Deserves large bonus

# Tier 2: ±500 kHz → +10 points  
# - Reasonable accuracy
# - Signal probably detectable
# - Moderate bonus

# Penalty: >2 MHz → -20 points
# - Way off target
# - Wasting time in wrong area
# - Negative reinforcement
```

#### 3. SNR Achievement Bonus - The "Quality" Reward

**Why 15 dB Threshold?**
- **Communication Quality:** 15 dB SNR enables reliable digital communication
- **Practical Significance:** Industry standard for "good" signal quality
- **Clear Success Criterion:** Binary threshold for achievement

**Bonus Magnitude: +10 points**
- **Significant but not Dominant:** Important but doesn't override primary SNR reward
- **Achievement Recognition:** Celebrates reaching practical performance level

### Reward Function Alternatives Analyzed

#### Alternative 1: Sparse Reward
```python
reward = 100 if (snr > 20 and freq_error < 100e3) else 0
```
**Pros:** Clear success criterion, no reward shaping bias
**Cons:** Very sparse feedback, extremely slow learning, exploration problems

#### Alternative 2: Shaped Reward with Multiple Objectives
```python
reward = w1*snr + w2*(-freq_error) + w3*(-power_consumption) + w4*stability
```
**Pros:** Multi-objective optimization, comprehensive performance
**Cons:** Weight tuning complexity, conflicting objectives, harder to debug

#### Alternative 3: Curiosity-Driven Reward
```python
reward = snr + novelty_bonus + exploration_bonus
```
**Pros:** Encourages exploration, discovers new signals
**Cons:** Complex to implement, might distract from main objective

#### Alternative 4: Adversarial Reward
```python
reward = snr - jammer_effectiveness + anti_jam_bonus
```
**Pros:** Directly optimizes for adversarial scenarios
**Cons:** Requires jammer simulation, complex environment

**Why We Chose Current Design:**
- **Dense Feedback:** Every action gets meaningful reward signal
- **Aligned Incentives:** All reward components support the main objective
- **Interpretable:** Easy to understand why agent made specific decisions
- **Tunable:** Can adjust bonus magnitudes based on performance

## Design Trade-offs and Engineering Decisions

### State Space Trade-offs

#### Information vs Computation
**Current Choice: 256 dimensions**
- **Information Loss:** Downsampling from 1024 to 250 spectrum bins
- **Computational Gain:** 4x reduction in neural network input size
- **Real-time Feasibility:** Enables deployment on embedded systems

#### Absolute vs Relative Information
**Current Choice: Mix of both**
- **Absolute:** Current frequency, gain settings (where am I?)
- **Relative:** Spectrum shape, SNR (what do I see?)
- **Benefit:** Combines global context with local observations

### Action Space Trade-offs

#### Discrete vs Continuous
**Current Choice: Discrete (11³ = 1,331 actions)**
- **Learning Speed:** DQN proven faster than policy gradient methods
- **Stability:** Discrete actions more stable than continuous
- **Interpretability:** Easy to understand and debug actions

#### Granularity vs Learning Speed
**Current Choice: 11 levels per dimension**
- **Precision:** Fine enough for practical applications
- **Learning:** Small enough action space for reasonable convergence
- **Hardware:** Matches typical SDR control granularity

### Reward Function Trade-offs

#### Dense vs Sparse Rewards
**Current Choice: Dense rewards with bonuses**
- **Learning Speed:** Dense feedback accelerates learning
- **Exploration:** Bonuses encourage thorough search
- **Risk:** Potential reward hacking (optimizing bonuses instead of objective)

#### Single vs Multi-Objective
**Current Choice: SNR-primary with accuracy bonuses**
- **Focus:** Clear primary objective (SNR)
- **Guidance:** Secondary objectives provide search direction
- **Simplicity:** Easier to tune than complex multi-objective functions
