### **Training Results Achieved**
```
Training Episodes: 200
Training Time: 0.02 hours (1 minute)
Final Success Rate: 21% (learning is happening!)
Test Success Rate: 10-12% (model finding some signals)
Average SNR Found: 17.7 dB (good quality when found)
Average Convergence Time: 25-29 steps
```

## 🔧 **CURRENT PERFORMANCE ISSUES**

### **1. Model Learning Rate**
- **Issue**: Success rate is low (10-21%) but improving
- **Cause**: Model needs more training episodes
- **Solution**: Increase training episodes to 1000-2000

### **2. Exploration Strategy**
- **Issue**: Epsilon not decaying properly during training
- **Fix Applied**: ✅ Changed epsilon_decay from 0.995 to 0.99
- **Result**: Should improve learning convergence

### **3. Reward Function**
- **Issue**: Reward signals not strong enough for learning
- **Fix Applied**: ✅ Improved reward function with:
  - Doubled SNR importance
  - Progressive frequency accuracy rewards
  - Stronger bonuses for good performance
  - Capped penalties to prevent discouragement

### **4. Training Duration**
- **Issue**: 200 episodes insufficient for complex RL task
- **Recommendation**: Use 1000+ episodes for production training
